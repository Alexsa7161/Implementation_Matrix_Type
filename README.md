# Implementation_Matrix_Type
Task. Implement a custom Matrix type to work with matrices
of arbitrary size.  
the implementation must contain:  
- Structure for data storage;
- Constructors;
- Properties(Rows_Size, Columns_Size, access via the indexer property);
- Boolean properties(check for Empty, Squared, Unity, Symmetric);
- Standard matrix operations via operator overloading;
- Method for calculating the trace of a matrix;
- Static methods for generating a unity or zero matrix of a certain size;
- Method of converting a string into a matrix.
